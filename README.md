# greencycle
First steps to bring ultimate improvement in sustainability to households!

Greencycle is a project meant to help Alexa users rethink their recycling habits and carbon impact on the planet. 
Instead of reinventing the recycling process, we got to start changes in the minds of people, stimulating them to make smarter solutions about their recycling and sustainability daily activities.

It is an iOS app augmented by an Alexa Skill which will collect data about a household’s lifestyle using ResearchKit and CoreMotion API and calculate their carbon impact as well as providing relevant tips about greener and smarter lifestyle (such as about recycling).

Greencycle will present users with weekly statistics of their carbon footprint in a barchart (comparing their results to average US and world ones).

Greencycle Alexa skill will do the following:

"Alexa, open Greencycle."
"Your current footprint is: _NUMBER_. That's a significant improvement from last week. Doing great!"

"Alexa, give me a recycling tip."
"All plastic bottles can be recycled, from water bottles to salad dressing, so put all of them in your recycling container."

"Alexa, where is my stuff?"
“You package is arriving today by 9pm. Please don’t forget to recycle the plastic and cardboard packaging materials.”

"Alexa, I am leaving."
“Weather is nice today. Consider taking a walk to _BLANK_.”
